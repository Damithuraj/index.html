                who are in danger and i like to explain about Buddhism. I am thinking i was born to make this country

                <br /> <br />
                I am too much sensitive. I always trying to make my family happy. I will feel happy when my family
                is happy and my friends are happy. I like to do any work to my school. It makes me happy. Sometimes
                i am crying sometimes i feel angry but i still love my friends, my family, my country and my school.
                Not only for my family. I like to make my teachers happy. Specially my class teacher Aishani Senanayake.
                Not only she i like to make my other teachers as, Dilani miss, Kasuni miss, Madhavi miss, Kalani miss
                and my second father as principal of my school and vice principal and madams.

                My challenges i face
                <br /> <br />
                I face lots of challenges in my life. My first challenge is Scholarship exam. I first thought it will
                easy and i studied to won the challenge. My mother take me to lots of tution classes. My mother spent
                any prize of money to make me a good smart boy and to win this scholarship exam. Not only she my father
                and my class teachers try to take me to a good mark at last, It was a bad news, It is my marks are 136%
                In that moment i feel sad and dissapointed. Because i culdnt write the last page. but i didn't loose at
                that moment. My mother told me never stop the way that you are going. I also thought this might be my
                loosing time but i will pass my future exams O/L and A/L. And now i am trying and studying to pass my
                school grade 7 exam.
